## The Development Process ##

1. Create new branch
2. Write meaningful code
3. Create a Pull Request (PR)
4. Peer Developer reviews changes
5. If the developer likes the change, the developer approves the Pull Request
6. Now the code is in the master branch and is 'production ready'

Note that a Pull Request cannot go through without a review.

## Tasks ##

If you have a feature or bug you would like done/fixed, you can create a Github Issue (it is a tab on the website). Just describe what you want done into the form.
