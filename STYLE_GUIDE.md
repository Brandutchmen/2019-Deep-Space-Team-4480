## Code Standards ##

1. All variable and function names should be formatted as camelCase
2. All Class names should be PascalCase

When possible, use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) practices. Basically, if something can be broken into a class (like a shooter, intake, etc), you should do it.

All Classes and Functions should have a comment explaining what they are.

Always keep in mind that others will be reading your code. Because of this, try to comment often and structure thing in a logical fashion.
